I used microsoft copilot in this exercise to assist me with this exercise. I had not ever made server
with python before so it was useful on tellin me simple syntax thigs like how to split string into 
list at spesific characters or how to remove last element of list. Serch engines could also have been 
used for those things but sometimes I find it more effective to serch for info through copilot. I used 
maybe 50%-50% search engines and copilot to serac for information. I also like microsoft copilot over 
other llm's because it often gives you sources to its claims. However I do not use it for things that 
require in-depth knowledge since llm's make mistakes often with those. it is useful for syntax things,
recommending libraries or ways to implement certain things, but it can't code since it does not understand
context and thus is error prone. (Maybe it could be able to code fully, but it would be propably slower 
than to do it myself) I cannot say that copilot made any mistakes, since it did not code for me.It gave 
libraries, ideas and made recommendations. Some of those I ended up using, but some just were not good.
